    </p>
  
  
<h3>3.
					Vulnerability Description</h3>
<p>
Stagefright is a media library running in Android devices used as a backend engine for playing various multimedia formats such as MP3, MKV, MP4, etc.
</p>
<p>
A vulnerability exists in the library that is triggered when procesing a malformed MP4 video file. The bug can be used by a potential attacker to perform arbitrary operations on the victim device. 
</p>
<p>
In order to exploit the problem an attacker would need a victim to open an specially crafted MP4 video file. This could be done via sending an MMS message to the device, tricking the user into browsing a site controlled by the attacker or sending it via to app installed in the victim's device such as an instant messaging app.
</p>
<p>
The problem was assigned as critical severity by the vendor (Google) and it affects around 93% of Android mobile devices around the world.
</p>

<h3>4.
					Vulnerable packages</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="smbull3">Android Lollipop 5.1.1 without October security updates.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>5.
					Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds</h3>
<p>
  Vendor fixed issue in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository on October 2015 and notified it's partners on September 10, 2015.

<p>
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Joaquín Manuel Rinaudo and Iván Arce. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Programa Seguridad en TIC. 
</p>


<a id="td"></a><h3>7.
					Technical Description</h3>
<p>
While processing .mp4 media files, libstagefright uses a MPEG4Extrator to iterate over the different atoms calling 
<a target="_blank" href="http://androidxref.com/5.1.1_r6/xref/frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/OggExtractor.cpp#parseFileMetaData">MPEG4Extractor::parseChunk</a> to parse elements based on the Four Character Code (fourCC) it encounters.
</p>

<p>
Upon encountering elements with FourCC codes of "avcC" or "hvcC" the extractor will allocate a buffer, store the entire chunk in an array, tag it with a key corresponding to its fourCC code and defer further processing. 
</p>

<p>
Parsing of those elements will be picked up by convertMetaDataToMessage in <a target="_blank" href="http://androidxref.com/5.1.1_r6/xref/frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/Utils.cpp">Utils.cpp</a>

</p>

<p>
Starting in line 177 it parses a AVCDecoderConfiguration record and flattens an array of variable length elements into an allocated buffer of fixed size:

<p>
At line 202 a buffer of fixed size is allocated, the loop in line 205 iterates over an array of variable length elements. For each element, its length is obtained from the file as a 16bit unsigned integer and the corresponding data is copied into the allocated buffer at line 215.
</p>

<p>
The CHECK() performed in line 212 ensures that the specified length does not exceed the input buffer but it does not prevent overwriting of heap memory is the length of the provided data exceeds the size of the allocated buffer.
</p>

<p>
A malformed MP4 file with an AVCDecoderConfiguration record that includes an SPS record in which the sum of the sizes of data elements exceed the fixed size buffer will corrupt the heap. This can be done with a single element of 1020 bytes or with multiple smaller elements.  
</p>

<p>
In either case, the setRange() call in line 216 will fail when it attempts to set the range past the allocated buffer's size, terminating the process. At this point the heap has already been corrupted by the memcpy() operation in  line 215 but it is unclear whether this can be exploited for anything different than a crash. 
</p>

<p>
The same issue is found 2 more times in Utils.cpp when processing a Picture Parameter Sets (PPS) record starting at <a target="_blank" href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/android-5.1.1_r13/media/libstagefright/Utils.cpp#235">235</a>  and in the processing array of NAL units in the HVCC record starting at line  <a target="_blank" href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/android-5.1.1_r13/media/libstagefright/Utils.cpp#255">255</a>
